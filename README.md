A mod to infinitely fly with an elytra without fireworks. It only controls your player's pitch to take advantage of Minecraft's physics, so it is essentially a smart macro, not a hack!

There is a keybind to toggle the mod (H by default). To start flying you can either get 50 blocks of height and jump off (and open your elytra), or use a firework rocket (the mod will automatically pitch you up to gain height).
When you start flying, the mod will:
- Pitch down to 34째.
- Wait until you are 5 blocks above the ground or are faster than 45 blocks/second.
- Pitch up to -47째 and slowly move your camera down by 10째/second until it gets back to 34째 down OR you lose all of your vertical speed (in which case you pitch down immediately).

This method will gain you ~3 blocks of height per iteration, so you can fly for as long as your elytra lasts!

This mod currently has no collision avoidance and uses the top block in the chunk, so it will work poorly in the Nether (in The End the mod will use the velocity cut off).
